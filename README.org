*semidiscrete* is a header-only C++ library that solves the semidiscrete transport
 equation using stochastic methods.

*semidiscrete* depends only on [[http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][Eigen3]].

* Semidiscrete transport functor
Recall the semidiscrete transport equation:
#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports none :file transport.png
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i - \int \min_i\, (\|x - x_i\|^2 - v_i) \,\mathrm{d}x
.
\end{equation}
#+END_SRC

The core of *semidiscrete* is in the various optimization routines present in
=include/optimize.hpp=. To use these routines, we must define a functor that
represents the semidiscrete transport equation as a multivariate function that
needs to be minimized. This functor records state about the function value and
gradient at each point.

The semidiscrete functor implements the equation above as:
#+BEGIN_SRC c++ :exports code
template <typename Sampler>
class SemidiscreteTransport {
private:
  Sampler sampler;
  int num_samples;

public:
  MatrixXd points;

  SemidiscreteTransport(const Sampler &sampler_, const MatrixXd &points_,
                        const int num_samples_)
      : sampler(sampler_), num_samples(num_samples_), points(points_) {}

  /**
   * Compute the transport cost and gradient with given weights.
   *
   * @param w VectorXd Power cell weights, w_i is associated to x_i.
   * @param grad VectorXd Gradient given by -1/n + density(x_i)
   * */
  double operator()(const VectorXd &w, VectorXd &grad) {
    int num_points = points.cols();
    for (int i = 0; i < num_points; ++i) {
      grad[i] = -1.0 / num_points;
    }

    double fx = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_samples; ++i) {
      auto p = sampler();

      Eigen::VectorXd::Index min_pos;
      auto dist =
          ((points.colwise() - p).colwise().squaredNorm() - w.transpose())
              .minCoeff(&min_pos);
      fx += dist / num_samples;
      grad[static_cast<int>(min_pos)] += 1.0 / num_samples;
    }

    return fx;
  }
};
#+END_SRC

This relies on a =Sampler= object that returns a sample point when called.

* Samplers
There are a few common distributions already implemented, including multivariate
normal distributions, uniform distributions, and data distributions, and these
can be combined into mixture distributions.

To implement your own distribution, create a =class= or =struct= that implements a
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
Eigen::VectorXd operator()() const {  }
#+END_SRC
which returns a sample from the distribution as an =Eigen= vector.

* Example
A simple example uses the =AdamSolver= with default parameters on a Gaussian distribution
and prints the number of iterations and estimated cost:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
int main() {
  // Compute the transport cost between 100 samples from a Gaussian and the distribution itself
  int num_points = 100;
  int num_samples = 10000;
  int num_dim = 2;

  // Want to approximate a Gaussian distribution
  VectorXd mu1 = VectorXd::Zero(num_dim);
  auto mu = MultivariateNormal(mu1, 1 * MatrixXd::Identity(num_dim, num_dim));

  // Initial point positions
  MatrixXd points = mu(num_points);
  VectorXd weights = VectorXd::Zero(num_points);
  // Define transport problem
  SemidiscreteTransport<MultivariateNormal> problem(mu, points, num_samples);

  // Setup Adam parameters and create solver
  AdamParams params;
  params.max_iterations = 200;
  AdamSolver solver(params);

  double fx;
  int iters = solver.minimize(problem, weights, fx);

  std::cout << iters << " iterations" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "weights = \n" << weights.transpose() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "cost = " << fx << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

This example can be compiled and run with CMake.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cmake .
make
./bin/test-semidiscrete
#+END_SRC

* Caveats
The semidiscrete problem is a concave maximization problem that is twice
differentiable. This makes it suitable to second order methods, but computing
the Hessian of the cost requires integrating densities over measure 0 sets.
While this can be done in 2 and 3 dimensions using [[https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_2/classCGAL_1_1Regular__triangulation__2.html][power cell constructions]],
extending this procedure to higher dimensions is difficult.

This library implements only first order methods for solving the semidiscrete
problem, and uses Monte Carlo integration to estimate densities of power cell
regions.

The estimation problems suffer inherently from curse of dimensionality, and
convergence within numerical tolerance in high dimensions is unlikely. For this
reason, you can set a maximum number of iterations for each optimization method,
as well as a maximum wall clock time. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
// Setup Adam parameters and create solver
AdamParams params;
params.max_iterations = 200;
params.max_time = 10; // in seconds
#+END_SRC
